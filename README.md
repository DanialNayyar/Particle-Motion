# Particle-Motion

This file contains implementation of the particle motion under various conditions. For example teh first one is a simulation of particles and how they behave as they collide with each other and the container wall. In this case, it is a simple simulation only concerned with the Newtons Laws of Motion and nothing else. 

Future Editions include:
-Vortex Motion (Particles in a vortex and sperating from each other due to their relative densities, commonly seen in fluid dynamics and used as a seperationn mechanism in slurrys.)

Harmonic Oscilations (of Fluids) - Useful when analysing wave behaviour, for example when looking at how waves beahve due to wind, movement of air particles due to sound waves etc.
